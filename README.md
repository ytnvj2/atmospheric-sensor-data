##### A laboratory uses five highly sophisticated sensors to continuously capture atmospheric data. The data is taken at random interval over a long period of time automatically. There is an event recorder which records an atmospheric event (basically a parameter) at random interval. There is a mathematical relationship between the data captured by the sensors & the event recorded by the recorder
##### You are provided a training set of sensor data & its corresponding event value. You need to use this training dataset to predict the atmospheric eventâ€™s value using another set of test sensor data. You are basically going to use training dataset to learn the relationship between sensor data & recorded atmospheric event. Then you are going to use that learning to predict future atmospheric event using a set of test data from the same sensors
